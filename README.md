#### Assignment - Data Generation using Modelling and Simulation for Machine Learning
  - Step1: Find a relevant simulation tool/ software/ library/ package of your interest. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_computer_simulation_software
  - Step2: Install the simulator and Explore it.
  - Step3: Study the different relavant/important parameters and find its lower and upper bound.
  - Step4: Generate random set of parameters, pass to the simulator and record the value.
  - Step5: Generate 1000 similations.
  - Step6: Generate a comparision table of 5-10 ML models on different evaluation parameters and report the best one.
